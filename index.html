            <p>My name is Bill Downey and I'm originally from New Jersey. I currently live in Charlotte, NC and graduated from West Virginia University with a BA. 
            <br>
            <br>    
            I have worked in the tech field for several years as a IT Recruiter and always wanted to learn to be a Developer.
               I owned and operated my own Coffee Shop for several years and have been looking for a career change back into the IT Industry.
               <br> 
                <br>
               I'm a big outdoors fan and enjoy hiking and all water sports. I'm a father of three children.
